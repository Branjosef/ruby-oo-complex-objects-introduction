# Introduction to Building Complex Class Objects in Ruby

As we covered previously, we use classes as blueprints for objects. These objects
are the basic building-blocks of Ruby code. We have introduced using instance methods,
variables, and attribute accessors independently. Now we'll focus on using them in
combination to build an object oriented program.

In the following lessons we'll explain these concepts:

* What code design is
* Basic code design principles that object orientated programmers employ
* The concept of a domain model

We'll be building a domain model for complex classes that represent the
intricacies of real world systems such as writing instance methods that
manipulate nested data structures in our object-oriented programs.
