# Introduction to Building Complex Class Objects in Ruby

As we covered previously, we use classes as blueprints for objects. These
objects are the basic building blocks of Ruby code. We have introduced using
instance methods, variables, and attribute accessors independently. Now we'll
focus on using them in combination to build an object-oriented program.

In the following lessons we'll explain these concepts:

* What code design is
* Basic code design principles that object-oriented programmers employ
* The concept of a domain model

By combining the different concepts we've learned, we can use classes to model
the intricacies of real-world domains and systems!
