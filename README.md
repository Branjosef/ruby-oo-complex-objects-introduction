# Introduction to Building Complex Class Objects in Ruby

As we covered previously, we use classes as blueprints for objects. Objects are
the basic building-blocks of Ruby code (everything in Ruby is an object). When
defining a class, we typically focus on two main properties: states and
behaviors. Ruby classes are the blueprints that establish what attributes (also
known as states) and behaviors (known in Ruby as methods) that an object should
have.

In the following lessons we'll explain these concepts:

* What a class is
* What code design is
* Basic code design principles that object orientated programmers employ
* The concept of a domain model

We'll also be working through a few tasks such as creating a database model for
a domain model with different types of object associations, Writing instance
methods that manipulate nested data structures, and building an object oriented
program.
